This project is related to the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), a month-long event to *"invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects."*

## Hacktoberfest contributions exclusion

This repo participate in the Hacktoberfest, but because it's not code related, I prefer to avoid (at least for the beginning) to count PRs for the festival & to include the `hacktoberfest` tag.

If you want to learn or educate about open source, you're in the right place.
